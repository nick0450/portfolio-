                   <p> We wanted to know in our experiment if people could distinct the colors and flavor of M&M's and Skittles,
                   and which onne could people tell better. So, we had 50 people take a survey that contained 2 data points (Skittles taste test, M&M taste test). 
                   The people surveyed had to close their eyes and try to distinct the flavor of the Skittle or M&M. What we found out judging by the data above, 
                   is that people could distinct Skittles much more than M&M's and that it is nearly impossible besides guessing to know the M&M color without 
                   looking at the color beforehand. So, we had answered our question, and now know people can distinct the flavor of Skittles over M&M's, which I 
                   had expected. This was a fun and delicious experiment!</p>
